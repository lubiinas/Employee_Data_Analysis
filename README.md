# Employee_Data_Analysis
# Employee Data Analysis Project  

## **Overview**  
This project involves analyzing employee data from ABC company. The dataset consists of **458 rows and 9 columns**, covering information such as **team, position, salary, age, and height**.  
The goal is to preprocess the data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualize key insights.

## **Preprocessing Steps**  
- **Fixed Missing Data:** Checked and handled any missing values.  
- **Corrected the "Height" Column:** Replaced it with random values between **150 and 180 cm** for data consistency.  
- **Removed Duplicates:** Ensured data integrity before analysis.

## **Analysis Tasks & Visualizations**  

### **1. Employee Distribution Across Teams**  
- Employees are distributed among multiple teams.  
- A **pie chart** was created to visualize the percentage distribution of employees in each team.  


### **2. Employee Segregation by Position**  
- Employees were categorized based on their positions.  
- A **bar chart** was used to show the number of employees in each role.  

### **3. Predominant Age Group**  
- The **most common age group** among employees was identified.  
- A **histogram** helped visualize the age distribution.  

### **4. Highest Salary Expenditure by Team & Position**  
- The **teams and positions with the highest salary expenses** were analyzed.  
- **Bar charts** were used to highlight the top teams and positions based on salary expenditure.  

### **5. Correlation Between Age & Salary**  
- Analyzed whether **age affects salary**.  
- A **scatter plot** was used to visualize the relationship.

## **Key Insights & Findings**  
- **Employee Distribution:** Some teams have significantly more employees than others.  
- **Salary Analysis:** Certain positions receive **higher salaries**, contributing to team-wise salary expenditure.  
- **Age Trends:** Younger employees tend to be in junior positions, whereas **higher salaries** are concentrated among experienced employees.  
- **Correlation Between Age & Salary:** There is a **moderate correlation**, indicating salary increases with age to some extent but is not a strict rule.
